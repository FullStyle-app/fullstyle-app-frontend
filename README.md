# FullStyle

FullStyle is a web application designed for style developers to create a social platform where they can share their style codes, knowledge, and inspiration with others. Users can create profiles, post their style codes, comment on other users' posts, and add posts to their favorites.

## Project Description

This repository contains the frontend code for the FullStyle application, built using React.js. The backend code (Express API) can be found in a separate repository at the FullStyle GitHub organization.

## About the Team

Pauline is UX/UI Designer and Web Dev Fullstack as well, her work is also available on her [Github](https://github.com/Paulinecvt). You'll be able to find our portfolios as well.
